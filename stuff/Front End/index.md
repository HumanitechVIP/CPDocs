# User Interface Mockups / Front-end web development

### Preliminary Note

Before starting any prototyping or design mockups, it is **paramount** to do user research
and understand the problem at hand, why you are solving this problem, what needs and pains users experience, and 
opportunities to innovate. 

In doing any design work or innovation, I always follow the user-centered designed process. It has 6 steps:

1. Understand
2. Define
3. Sketch
4. Decide
5. Prototype
6. Validate

These steps are explained further on [Google's Design Sprint Website]. (https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview)


## Understand / Define
To understand the problem, I went through past midterm presentations to see who the stakeholders where, what the 
problem was, and what constraints there were. After this, we created a **use-case model** and I created a short 
**user stories** spreadsheet.

## Sketch / Decide
In starting to visualize what the app might look like, I used some ideation tips in Google's Design Sprint Website,
which include doing **"Crazy-eights"** and **storyboarding**. After coming up with as many ideas as I could, I consulted
the team and decided on a few good attributes of the UI. 

Next, I had to create a digital sketch. I did this in **Adobe Xd**, as I had already had experience with that software,
but **Figma** is also a great resource. Figma is better for online collaboration, however I feel that Adobe Xd is more
powerful and intuitive. After creating a few different options for both mobile and web design, I consulted with
my team again to see what features should stay and iterated again.

## Prototype
Next, I had to move on to creating the actual webpage, which involves **HTML**,**CSS**, and**JS**. There are many
tutorials on how to make a webpage, but I especially like **w3 schools** for any web development help. I also used
**Bootstrap**, which is like a pre-built CSS library that helps create layouts and things like navigation bars,
forms, titles, buttons, etc in a pretty format just by adding a certain class name to that element.
