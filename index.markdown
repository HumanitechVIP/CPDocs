# Greetings

Hello! This is going to be a central location for all of the things we've learned for this project.

This documentation is here to serve the purpose of providing some assistance when lost. I know when I first started in this VIP, I knew nothing. Now I know some things.

### First Things First

This documentation is made using Jekyll. To update this documentation, pull the repo in the HumanitechVIP page.

1. Pull the repo by going to a folder on your computer and
   `git clone git@github.com:HumanitechVIP/CPDocs.git`

2. You should have access to the repo, set in GitHub. Next, update the pages via only the markdown (.md) files. Do NOT modify `_site` because nothing will change -- and don't modify the Gemfile or config unless you know what you want to change.

3. Once you make changes, add, commit, and push to `gh-pages` branch.
   `git add .`
   `git commit -m "<some message here>"`
   `git push origin gh-pages`

4. GitHub pages should automatically update the website after a few minutes.
